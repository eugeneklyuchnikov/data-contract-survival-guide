Hey Kev, can you give me a data dump for the new "Gamification" feature events? I need to build a dashboard to track user engagement.

Looks like we have the user ID, a timestamp, the type of event, and then some metadata blob for the specifics. This is super important for the product team.

Let's make sure this data is reliable going forward.
