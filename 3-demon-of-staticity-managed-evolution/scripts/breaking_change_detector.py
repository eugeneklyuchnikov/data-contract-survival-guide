breaking_change_detector.py

A simple script to detect breaking changes between two data contract versions.
- A breaking change is defined as removing or renaming a field.
- Exits with status code 1 if a breaking change is found, 0 otherwise.

Usage:
python breaking_change_detector.py <path_to_old_contract> <path_to_new_contract>
